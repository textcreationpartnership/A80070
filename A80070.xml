            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have received yours of the 14. 21. and 28. of <hi>February,</hi> and answered them by Mr. <hi>Abraham Goultier,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lucyes</hi> man of <hi>London:</hi> on Saterday last, came newes from our Army, by the Earle of <hi>Roscomon,</hi> who left them at <hi>Bellenparke,</hi> in the County of <hi>Wexford,</hi> on Wednesday the eight Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; all in a prosperous estate, thankes be to God; I shall write you particularly of their journey thither, as I have it from the best relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, but as concerning their further designe, I cannot write you for certaine, but out of my owne conjecture, I shall trouble you with my owne opinion therein; they were then in the place betweene <hi>Wex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Waterford</hi> and <hi>Rosse,</hi> my opinion is, they will for <hi>Wexford,</hi> first, because (although it be strong) it is farthest from the enemies Army, which are gathering at <hi>Kilkeney,</hi> and I beleeve they have drawne men thence to <hi>Kilkeney,</hi> expecting the comming of our Army thither: secondly, it is the Port into the which all their Ammunition and assistance from Foraine parts comes, and there doubtlesse is much at this time; and from thence doe they transport all the Native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, which being of little value amongst them, yeelds them great benefit being transported, and much more it concernes us the taking of it. Time will not permit me to write, but one thing, having it, we can carry all our Ammunition thence to <hi>Waterford</hi> and <hi>Rosse,</hi> by water, having already the Fort of <hi>Dunkonnon,</hi> which may be the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier gaining of both those places, but what of all these opportunities so much concerning our Christian Warfare, if we have not a supply of men out of <hi>England,</hi> that so much tender our good, as to come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to Garrison, and hold those places, but come and take the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings that God hath bestowed; but I perceive (notwithstanding what you have written) there is no Cessation of Armes in <hi>England,</hi> but kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling one another with such Zeale, as if they were not of one and the same Religion: where is their compassion of our misery? where is their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:157276:3"/> affection to the cause in hand here? but that it might be said, the Lod will save us without you; our misery is much, and much more increasing here; But I will let to spend my time to write what God hath done with our Army.</p>
            <p>I wrote you of their going forth the first currant, and their strength (or rather their weaknesse, comparing with the enemies forces) I have written you before. On Fryday the third Currant, they came to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stlemartin,</hi> and drawing toward the Castle, there came out one Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, (who had some command there) and desired Quarter, which was granted, and, without resistance, they yeelded the Castle, from whence went about 300. men women, and children, but very few men, and not above sixteene fit to beare Armes. Our Army had a good Quarter of it there that night, but some of our men quartered further, there was much Corne and provision there; it is thought that there and at <hi>Tymalin</hi> (which was taken after) was at least 3000. Bushels of Corne, besides great store of good pillage, they left a Garrison there. And on Saterday the fourth, they marcht towards <hi>Moone,</hi> which is halfe a mile from <hi>Tymalin,</hi> intending to passe by <hi>Tymalin</hi> (because it was mightily fortified) and to quarter at <hi>Moone,</hi> where was a garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Rogues, but yeelded upon quarter, but passing by <hi>Tymalin,</hi> most of the Army and the Ordnance having gone beyond it, for our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was not appointed to meddle with it, nor any other place of strength, whereby to spend any time by the way, but my Lord of <hi>Ormond,</hi> would omit no opportunity of comming unto the place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be at, but onely to take up such places for quartering of the Souldiers, as might be easily obtained without losse of time, or men, or spending Ammunition, and that he might obtaine the place aymed at, before the enemy should be ready to oppose him. But from <hi>Tymalin</hi> came forth five Horsemen toward our Army, passing by (there being a Brooke betweene them and our Army, and one of them drew his sword and flourisht it, and bid our men come over, whereupon my Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> commanded backe the Army and the Ordnance (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the strength of the place, whereon the enemy so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently relyed, more then on what God could doe against it. In the meane time, foure or five of our horsemen made over the Brooke, unto the five Rebels; and in pursuit of them they came upon an Ambush of Muskettiers of the Rogues, notwithstanding they dismounted one of the Rogues and brought away his horse, the rest of that day and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:157276:3"/> Saterday night, our Muskettiers playd on their outworkes. On Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day morning they beat them out of the Trenches into the Castle, and Church, and steeple upon which our Ordnance played al Sunday and Munday the sixth, till about noone, and obtaining all those places with the losse of Lieutenant <hi>Olliver,</hi> two Sergeants of note, and some others, about twelve in all, they entred the Castle, but in their entrance the women there, which were appointed, by my Lord, to be saved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, them and their children, those did much hurt to our men, who being so much incenst against them, they slew all, men, women, and children; about 600. amongst which there were very proper men. In which place, I heard that one of our Army got 1500. pounds in money and plate, and many others got good booties; a friend of mine writ to me that he mist of 600. pounds in money for want of more diligence. On Saterday night and Sunday night, my Lord quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at <hi>Moone,</hi> and on Munday afternoone, they left <hi>Tymalin,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Garrison; they went forward towards <hi>Catterlagh</hi> (commonly called <hi>Carlagh,)</hi> which they could not reach that night, but comming to their Randezvous, at <hi>Bolton</hi> hill, they met with Captaine <hi>Harmon,</hi> and Captaine, or Lieutenant <hi>Grymes,</hi> who came with about 80. horse, and 120. Foot; from their Garrisons, (in or about <hi>Arthy)</hi> to meete my Lord and our Army, with 12. or 14. prisoners, three Collours, and 100. Armes, that they got in the way to <hi>Bolton</hi> hill, for on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday the fourth, they met with 400. well Armed Rebels, with 4. or 500. Cowes; marching towards <hi>Kilkemy,</hi> to joyne with <hi>Preston,</hi> and making a retreat for gaining of good ground, they obtained their desire, and falling on the Rogues, slew (some write 200. some 160. besides prisoners,) about 200. in all, and tooke all their Cattle, and brought either 12. or 14. prisoners to my Lord, two Ensignes, and one Captaine, a Frenchman named <hi>Lynnod,</hi> they kept some alive, to be guides for our Army in the way; and Captaine <hi>Lynnod,</hi> because he was a stranger, and a good Souldier, the rest they hanged there; that Munday night they could no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:157276:4"/> without bread, and cold water instead of hot water, in <hi>Dublin,</hi> but God hath better provided for them, for the Rebells expecting their comming to <hi>Kilkenay,</hi> caused all the Country to be burnt before them that our Army might finde no provision, and thither were they gathering great strength, but their Cattle and what there could not be contained within their Walles, they sent into the County of <hi>Wexford,</hi> having there better shelter by meanes of the woods, then elsewhere; wherein God was pleased to defeate their Counsell, insomuch that our Army met with such plenty of all sorts of daintyes, that Mutton and Beefe began to be grosse meate, and no man present to begrudge it them, there plenty of Cattle you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but conceive that they tooke, and yet at my Lord of <hi>Roscomons</hi> returne from <hi>Balleneparke</hi> from the Army the eighth, hee saw in the way which our Army had past such a multitude of Cattell as if that they had brought out of the woods to feede after our Army was past as if our Army had not gone that way; from <hi>Catterlagh</hi> they came Tuesday night the seventh, they came to Master <hi>Cheevers</hi> house at <hi>Grangefort</hi> and quartered there, where was none found but three Maides, passing by <hi>Tally</hi> they found the Towne set on fire, by one of my Lords kinsmen, who refused to suffer my Lord to quarter there in his owne house, but burnt the Towne and carryed all the goods into the Castle, but my Lord would not spend any time to secure any thing that concerned his particular benefit (as some Commanders would have done) but more aymed at the Common good; from <hi>Chevers</hi> they went to Master <hi>Beverly Brittaynes</hi> house at <hi>Balleneparke</hi> in the County of <hi>Wexford,</hi> one mile from <hi>Clehammons,</hi> and sixe from <hi>Erinscorthy,</hi> from thence all were fled, and carryed their goods to <hi>Wexford,</hi> so that the Earle of <hi>Roscomon</hi> left them all safe on Wednesday the eight, and brought us all the newes hither on Saterday. I have heard a Relation, and for certaine it is, that part of our Army going downe <hi>Burat,</hi> both the Towne and Castle of <hi>Kildaer,</hi> and having there and at other places, so much pillage, they could not but leave very rich things behinde them, which they burnt: you may then thinke what good things they have with them; and above all they have the speciall assistance of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. Yesterday the 14. went forth my Lord of <hi>Roscomon,</hi> and Sir <hi>Morice Eustace</hi> to <hi>Tredagh,</hi> to meet with my Lord <hi>Moore,</hi> who are on Fryday to meete the Earle of <hi>Colnirichard</hi> at <hi>Titchmore,</hi> there to heare
